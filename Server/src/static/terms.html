Tatamee reserves all rights in the content of the RSS feeds and may terminate any RSS feed at any time.</h2>
<h2>Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to you by Tatamee immediately terminates said permission or license. In order to collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make derivative use of the Service or any Content made available via the Service for other purposes (including commercial purposes) not stated herein, you must first obtain a license from Tatamee.</h2>
<h3>Termination of service</h3>
