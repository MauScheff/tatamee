<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div id="content">
<h2>Tatamee has established this Privacy Policy to explain to you how your information is protected, collected and used, which may be updated by Tatamee from time to time. Tatamee will provide notice of materially significant changes to this Privacy Policy by posting notice on the Tatamee site.</h2>
<h2>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal information for our services on the Tatamee websites. It applies generally to the Tatamee.com website and content and other related websites where this policy appears in the footer of the page. Some Tatamee-branded websites or websites we operate may be governed by separate privacy policies. The policy that applies on any of our domains or subdomains is always the policy that appears in the footer of each website.</h2>
<h2>By accepting this Privacy Policy in registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective on January 1st, 2010.</h2>
<h3>Collection</h3>
<h2>You can browse our sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in <u>Google App Engine, and therefore agree to their terms of use and privacy policy</u>. We may collect and store the following personal information:</h2>
<ul>
<li><h2>email address, physical contact information, and (depending on the service used) sometimes financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers;</h2></li>

<li><h2>shipping, billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item;</h2></li>
<li><h2>community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our sites, and correspondence sent to us;</h2></li>

<li><h2>additional information we ask you to submit to authenticate yourself or if we believe you are violating site policies;</h2></li>
<li><h2>information from other companies, such as demographic and navigation data; and;</h2></li>
<li><h2>other supplemental information from third parties.</h2></li>
</ul>
<h3>Protection</h3>
<h2>At Tatamee we recognize that privacy is important, therefore, we don't sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services, content and advertising. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate so in your preferences. In addition to the aforementioned, we don't:</h2>
<ul>
<li><h2>Run banner ads, pop ups, pop unders, or any other kind of commercial ads.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Engage in cross-marketing or link-referral programs with other sites.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Employ tracking devices for marketing purposes ("cookies", "web beacons," single-pixel gifs).</h2></li>
<li><h2>Send you unsolicited communications for marketing purposes.</h2></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tatamee, or people who post on Tatamee, may provide links to third party websites, which may have different privacy practices. We are not responsible for, nor have any control over, the privacy policies of those third party websites, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited.</h2>
<h3>Use</h3>
<h2>Tatamee only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. You agree that we may use your personal information for the following purposes:</h2>
<ul>
<li><h2>Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising, as well as the customer support you request;</h2></li>
<li><h2>Resolving disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</h2></li>
<li><h2>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</h2></li>
<li><h2>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network;</h2></li>
<li><h2>Preventing potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement; </h2></li>
<li><h2>Protecting the rights or property of Tatamee or our users; and </h2></li>
<li><h2>Customizing, measuring and improving our services, content and advertising; </h2></li>
<li><h2>Telling you about our services and those of our corporate family, targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; and </h2></li>
<li><h2>Comparing information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Developing new services.</h2></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tatamee processes personal information on our servers in Google App Engine In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners.</h2>
<h3>Information sharing</h3>
<h2>Tatamee only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Tatamee in the following limited circumstances:</h2>
<ul>
<li><h2>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</h2></li>
<li><h2>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. </h2></li>
<li><h2>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Tatamee, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</h2></li>
</ul>
<h2>Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</h2>
<h2>If Tatamee becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<h2>When you visit Tatamee, we send one or more cookies &mdash a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Tatamee also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the website. We may set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit our website, including Tatamee sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Tatamee's advertising services.</h2>
<h2>A few important things you should know about cookies are that:</h2>
<ul>
<li><h2>We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.</h2></li>
<li><h2>We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.</h2></li>
<li><h2>Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.</h2></li>
<li><h2>You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our sites or services. </h2></li>
<li><h2>You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)</h2></li>
</ul>
<h3>Using information from Tatamee</h3>
<h2>Tatamee enables you to share personal and financial information to complete transactions. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions. When users are involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information. In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.</h2>
<h2>You agree to use user information only for:</h2>
<ul>
<li><h2>Tatamee transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages; </h2></li>
<li><h2>Using services offered through Tatamee (such as escrow, shipping, and fraud complaints), or</h2></li>
<li><h2>Other purposes that a user expressly chooses.</h2></li>
</ul>
<h3>Information security</h3>
<h2>Your information is stored on Google App Engine. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</h2>
<h3>Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
<h2>You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to Tatamee. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Tatamee User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</h2>
<h3>Data integrity</h3>
<h2>Tatamee processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</h2>
<h3>Third Parties</h3>
<h2>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Tatamee does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</h2>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<h2>Please note that we may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the site.</h2>
